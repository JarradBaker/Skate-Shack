    <!-- HISTORY OF SKATE SHACK SECTION -->
    <section id="history-section">
        <h2>The History Of Skate Shack</h2>
        <p>
            Skate Shack started out as an idea between two friends in 2020. They were sick of paying extortionate amounts of money for poor quality skateboards, so decided to do something about it. After skating themselves for years, they knew the best quality boards, but would need to find a way to get them for as cheap as possible, to provide their customers with the service they longed for themselves. Enter X sports UK.
        </p>
        <p>
            X sports UK is a competition for skateboarders held in the UK. Both friends had entered other competitions before, but without much success. This time however, they didn't have a choice. They knew that they needed to place high in order to begin negotiations with the potential brands that they wanted to work with. Fate is a strange thing. A strange thing indeed. They had done it, they both finished top 10, with one finishing 2nd.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now they had the leverage that they needed to begin negotiations with their chosen brands. Their vision had finally become reality. Sales began soaring, and growth was inevitable. They are still realising their dreams today, through the combination of their love for skating, and heads for business.
